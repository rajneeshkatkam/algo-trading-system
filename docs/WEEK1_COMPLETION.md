## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
cd /Users/rajneeshkatkam/Documents/algo-trading

# Run initial setup
./scripts/setup.sh
# OR
make setup
```

### 2. Start Development
```bash
# Start infrastructure only
make infra-start

# Start everything (infrastructure + market data service)
make start

# Check status
make status
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/stocks

# Run tests
make test

# View logs
make logs SERVICE=timescaledb
```

## 📊 API Endpoints Available

### Market Data Service (Port 8080)
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/stocks` - List all stocks
- `GET /api/v1/stocks/{symbol}/ohlcv` - Get OHLCV data
- `GET /api/v1/stocks/{symbol}/ticks` - Get tick data
- `GET /ws` - WebSocket connection for real-time data
